# Learn Hub – Online Learning Platform (MERN Stack)
Learn Hub is a web-based online learning platform developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). 
The goal of this project is to provide a seamless experience for users to browse, enroll in, and manage educational courses. It includes both a user interface for students and an admin dashboard for managing course content.

This project helps in understanding full-stack development, API handling, authentication, and real-time data interaction using MongoDB.
It is a great learning resource for anyone who wants to build and deploy a full-stack application from scratch.
